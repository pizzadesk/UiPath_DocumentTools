# Cross-Platform UiPath Activities for Office File Manipulation

Welcome to the Cross-Platform UiPath Activities repository! This collection of UiPath activities is designed to provide seamless manipulation of Office files across different UiPath platforms. The primary goal is to empower users to work with Office files without the need for a Microsoft Office license.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Activities are designed to work on various operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS (64-bit)), ensuring a consistent experience across platforms.
  
- **Built-in Dependencies:** The activities leverage built-in dependencies for version 23.10 to streamline the installation process and reduce external dependencies.

- **No Microsoft Office License Required:** Perform Office file manipulation without the need for a Microsoft Office license, making it cost-effective and accessible.

## Supported Activities

- **Spreadsheet (Excel Workbooks) Manipulation:** Efficiently read, write, and manipulate Excel files without relying on a Microsoft Excel license, using ClosedXML.

- **Document (Word) Operations:** Perform various operations on Word documents, such as editing, formatting, and extracting content, using OpenXML.

- **String Distance Calculations**: Leverage a library of workflows utilizing Invoke Code activities to perform four string distance calculations: Levenshtein Distance, Hamming Distance, Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and Jaro Distance. Each workflow accepts two input strings and outputs the calculated distance or similarity score, ideal for data validation, error correction, and duplicate detection.
